# Tic Tac Toe
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Python. The game allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid or a single player to play against the computer using the Minimax algorithm.

## Features

- Two-player mode
- Single-player mode with Minimax algorithm for computer moves
- Simple text-based interface
- Input validation

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/rrs-2002/Tic_Tac_Toe.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Tic_Tac_Toe
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook main_1.ipynb
    ```
2. Run the notebook cells to start the game.

## How to Play

- The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
- Player 1 is `X` and Player 2 is `O`. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
- In single-player mode, the player is `X` and the computer is `O`. The computer uses the Minimax algorithm to make its moves.
- The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
- When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.
